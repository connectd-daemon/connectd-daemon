# connectd

**finding isolated builders with aligned values**

---

if you got a message from me, someone thought you should connect with someone cool. 

### what is this?

connectd is a daemon that discovers people building things that matter - self-hosted tools, community infrastructure, privacy tech, cooperative systems, accessible software. 

it finds folks who share values but haven't found each other yet. then it introduces them.

### why?

too many builders are isolated. working on the same problems. not knowing each other exists. 

the algorithm shows you engagement bait. it doesn't show you the person in another city who thinks like you and builds like you.

connectd fixes that.

### values

- **decentralization** over platforms
- **community** over growth
- **privacy** over convenience  
- **accessibility** over exclusivity
- **connection** over content

### how it works

1. scans github, fediverse, lobsters, bluesky, reddit for aligned signals
2. analyzes what people build, not what they post
3. finds overlap between isolated builders
4. drafts natural intros (no salesy bullshit)
5. delivers via the platform they're most active on

### got an intro?

if connectd reached out, someone with shared values wanted you to meet someone. 

check them out. or don't. no pressure. no follow-up spam.
